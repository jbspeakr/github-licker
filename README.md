**Licker - Your Github License Checker for Organisational Repositories.**

Using the [Github API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/) including the [Licenses API](https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/) developer preview, 
Licker is able to check licenses of all repositories in your Github organisation. It helps especially identifying repos 
without license file.
